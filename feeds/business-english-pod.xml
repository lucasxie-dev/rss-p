<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on using visuals and describing charts and trends in an <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/presentations/" title="English presentations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English presentation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve all sat through boring presentations, with PowerPoints that are just slide after slide of too much text. If all you’re doing is reading off your slides, then why do a presentation at all? And if your audience falls asleep, then you’ve effectively communicated nothing.</p>
<p>If you really want to grab people’s attention, you use visuals. That could mean not just pictures, but graphs and charts. There’s no better way to represent data than with graphs. But the graph doesn’t do all the work for you. You still need to give it life and make it a seamless part of your overall presentation.</p>
<p>The first thing you might do is introduce the point you want to make, before you use the visual. And remember that your audience might have some understanding of the topic already, so you should acknowledge that. And you can make it dramatic by using foreshadowing and highlighting important points. And just like in any presentation, it’s good to use clear transitions between points and slides.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll hear a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/presentations/" title="English presentation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">presentation</a> from Pat, a director with a cell, or mobile phone manufacturer called Ambient. He’s presenting to the company’s sales team about how they’ve regained market share after a rough couple of years. We will hear how Pat uses visuals to enhance his presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	At the start of his presentation, what does Pat say they will focus on?<br />
2.	When talking about the company called Sirus, what does Pat “draw people’s attention” to?<br />
3.	What does Pat say to transition to showing information about Ambient?</p>

<p>Making and breaking your own habits is hard enough. But as a manager or leader, how can you make or break habits in other people? I mean, how can you make sure your employees have good habits? Well, here’s the sad truth: you can’t make people change. But you can create the conditions that foster good habits and disincentivize bad habits.</p>
<p>One thing to be mindful of from the outset is the difference between habits and simple compliance. I mean, do you want people to do something only if and when their boss is watching? Or do you want that behavior to be automatic, something that the employee does because that’s just how things work in your company. In other words: how things work in your culture, which includes people’s shared habits.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we look at how to develop good habits for success at work.</p>
<p>The start of a new year feels like the right time to make big resolutions, or promises to yourself. You’re going to call people back promptly. You’re going to keep a tidy desktop. You’re going to stop reading new emails as soon as they come in. You’re going to manage your time better. It sure feels great to make these resolutions. But what doesn’t feel great is the realization in February that you haven’t made good on any of your promises. </p>
<p>In most cases, the problem is that people intuitively believe that setting a goal or making a resolution is enough. But it’s not. Setting a goal without looking at the systems that support specific habits  or behaviors is useless. Intention isn’t enough. You need to break down what happens around habits, both good and bad, and create the right conditions for the right behaviors.</p>

But what doesn’t feel great is the realization in February that you haven’t made good on any of your promises. In most cases, the problem is that people intuitively believe that setting a goal or making a resolution is enough. But it’s not. Setting a goal without looking at the systems that support specific habits or behaviors is useless. Intention isn’t enough. You need to break down what happens around habits, both good and bad, and create the right conditions for the right behaviors.

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on finishing a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/meetings/" title="meeting English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meeting in English</a>. We’ll learn how to summarize action points and wrap up the meeting. </p>
<p>A well-run meeting can be productive and useful. But a poorly run meeting can leave everyone feeling like their time has been wasted. And one of the big differences between good and bad meetings is how they end.</p>
<p>A good meeting doesn’t slowly run out of energy. Instead, there’s a clear ending to it. And people come out of the meeting with a strong sense of purpose and a clear idea of what they need to do. Without a sense of purpose, people might feel like the meeting generated a lot of discussion but nothing more. </p>
<p>Giving a strong finish to a meeting isn’t actually that hard to do. First off, you need to be clear that the meeting is about to end. That gives people a chance to collect their thoughts. Next, you can summarize the action points and assign tasks. You may also want to emphasize how important they are to give some extra motivation. Then you can wrap up the meeting with some closing thoughts. </p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll join a meeting at a bank. The team has been discussing some recent issues and future plans. You will hear Lisa provide a strong finish to the meeting with James, Bryan, Charles, and Cecilia. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What question does Lisa ask the group before stating the action items?<br />
2.	What does Lisa emphasize about James planned action?<br />
3.	What does Lisa say to officially end the meeting?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/meetings/" title="English for meetings" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English for meetings</a> lesson on how to deal with interruptions during a meeting.</p>
<p>Meetings are a very important part of work life. They are where decisions are made, relationships are built, and work is coordinated. When meetings go smoothly, they can feel very productive. But meetings can easily become messy and unfocused.</p>
<p>In many cases, people compete for time and attention during <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/meetings/" title="English meetings" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meetings</a>. They interrupt each other to give new ideas, disagree, or try to get their way. Knowing how to deal with interruptions is a critical skill if you want to participate fully in a meeting.</p>
<p>Interrupting people is easier if you learn some useful phrases. You can also learn language to help you stop an interruption and finish what you were saying. In some cases, you might need to concede someone else’s point, either partly or fully. When we concede a point, we are saying “okay, you’re right.” Sometimes that’s the key to moving on after an interruption.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll join a meeting at a manufacturing company. Bill is the production manager and Mei Lin and Sam work in HR. They are discussing staffing and recruiting for a new production line. Bill is keen to hire new staff, but Sam and Mei Lin want to explore alternative approaches so there’s a lot of disagreement and interrupting during the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does Bill say is the purpose of the meeting?<br />
2.	What is one of the expressions Mei Lin uses to interrupt Bill when he’s speaking?<br />
3.	What does Bill say to get back to what he was trying to say after being interrupted?</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Pod for the second part of our look at <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2025/11/06/bep-418-english-for-projects-managing-conflict-with-contractors-1/" title="BEP 418 – English for Projects:  Managing Conflict with Contractors 1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">managing conflict with subcontractors</a>. In this lesson we’re going to focus on dealing with scope creep, cost disputes and conflicting priorities.</p>
<p>When things go sideways with contractors, it’s rarely because of one big mistake. It’s usually a thousand small disagreements that pile up. Different expectations, unclear goals, or shifting priorities can spoil what’s supposed to be a healthy collaboration. Learning to manage these conflicts will help you keep projects on track and maintain trust.</p>
<p>When problems come up, smart <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/project-management/" title="English for project managers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">project managers</a> don’t avoid the hard conversations. Instead, they face things head-on. This requires good communication skills, and fortunately, these skills can be learned. </p>
<p>Some of the things you might face are conflicts over the scope of a project or resources. And don’t be surprised if you disagree on money, or costs. Learning to face these issues directly is one thing. But you also need to learn the art of compromise and seek constructive solutions.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll join a telephone conversation between a project manager named Celia and a subcontractor named Raj. Celia works for a software development company that has hired Raj’s team to build a payment gateway module for a new banking app. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What piece of work do Celia and Raj disagree about, in terms of whether its part of the project scope?<br />
2.	What compromise does Celia suggest on the issue of costs?<br />
3.	At the end of the dialog, what solution does Celia state that she wants to see to prevent further problems?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for the first in a two-part lesson on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/project-management/" title="English for project management" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English for project management</a> and dealing with subcontractors. In this lesson we’re going to look at how to manage conflict with an external contractor.</p>
<p>Very few projects run perfectly smoothly. There are just too many variables involved to expect nothing to go wrong. One of the trickiest variables in any project is the people involved. And some of the trickiest people issues are conflicts with subcontractors or external vendors.</p>
<p>Conflict with subcontractors is almost inevitable. Different companies have different goals, priorities, and communication styles. Project managers who know how to handle tension early can prevent escalation and maintain a productive working relationship. And this can keep everyone focused on results instead of resentment.</p>
<p>Managing conflicts well requires a very tricky balance. You need to address issues and accountability head-on, while remaining diplomatic. You need to set expectations but steer away from too much blame. And it can be very helpful, as you do this, to reference documents to achieve clarity.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a telephone conversation featuring a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/project-management/" title="project manager English">project manager</a> named Celia at a software development company. Her company has outsourced the payment gateway module of a new banking app. Now she’s talking to Raj from the subcontractor about their first delivery, which doesn’t meet expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What are the problems that Celia introduces directly near the start of the dialog?<br />
2.	What document does Celia refer to in order to clarify their agreement?<br />
3.	At the end of the dialog, Celia sets some clear expectations. What’s the timeline she expects for the actions she mentions?</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we continue our look at how to develop a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/persuasion/" title="persuasion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">persuasive approach</a> in business.</p>
<p>To be persuasive in business, you need more than facts and logic, and you must also connect emotionally. People make decisions with both their minds and their hearts, so showing warmth and friendliness helps make them more open to your ideas.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be overly social; simply showing empathy and genuine interest in others is enough. Asking questions not only builds rapport but also gives you insight into what motivates people, allowing you to adapt your approach.</p>
<p>Emotions play a key role in persuasion. You can appeal to fear (“sales may drop if we don’t act”), hope (“this plan will give us our weekends back”), or pride (“this will make us leaders in our field”). Another powerful emotion is belonging &#8211; people want to feel part of a group or shared vision. You can use this by framing your message around teamwork or industry trends (“the whole industry is moving this way”).</p>
<p>A couple of useful techniques are contrasting and hyperbole. Contrasting means presenting two choices where one clearly supports your message. Adding hyperbole, or deliberate exaggeration, can also make your message more memorable (“this could be the most important decision in our company’s history”).</p>
<p>Persuasion isn’t purely an exercise in logic. It’s not just people’s minds that you need to consider, but also their hearts. That’s why we try to make a connection with them emotionally, or personally. We try to learn about them so we can adapt our approach. We appeal to a broad range of their emotions. And we use techniques like contrast and hyperbole to ramp up the impact of our ideas.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we look at how to develop a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/persuasion/" title="persuasion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">persuasive approach</a> in business.</p>
<p>Persuasion is one of the most valuable skills in business, enabling professionals to influence decisions, gain support, and advance ideas. But effective persuasion is not about slick talk or manipulation &#8211; it relies on sincerity and well-chosen techniques.</p>
<p>Sincerity is the foundation. People are persuaded when they believe you genuinely believe what you are saying. If your audience senses dishonesty or hidden motives, trust quickly erodes. To demonstrate sincerity, share how you came to believe in your idea. For example, acknowledge initial doubts and explain what changed your perspective. Transparency also plays a major role. If you stand to benefit personally, acknowledge it openly while emphasizing broader benefits. This honesty builds trust and credibility.</p>
<p>Once sincerity is established, persuasion comes down to tailoring your approach to your audience. Logical thinkers respond to structured reasoning, such as outlining clear criteria for a plan. Others may be more influenced by authority or social proof, in which case citing respected figures or supporters can be effective. The key is to understand what motivates the people you are trying to influence.</p>
<p>Beyond adapting to individual mindsets, several techniques are broadly effective. Repetition reinforces ideas and makes them more memorable. For example, emphasizing a chain of cause and effect &#8211; like lowering costs leading to stronger growth &#8211; creates impact. Rhetorical questions are another powerful tool, framing choices in a way that guides the audience toward your conclusion without directly telling them what to think.</p>
<p>In short, successful persuasion blends sincerity with strategy. Believe in your message, be transparent about your motives, and then apply techniques that resonate with your audience. With this balance of trust and skill, you can significantly enhance your ability to persuade in business.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson, the second part of our <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/finance-accounting/" title="English for Accounting and Finance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial English</a>  series on discussing an audit.</p>
<p>Money is the language of business, and audits are one way companies prove they can be trusted with it. Audits check whether financial records are accurate and reliable. They help investors, managers, and the public see that the numbers tell the truth about the organization’s money.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been a part of a discussion about an audit, you’ll know that there’s a lot of specialized language in the world of finance. And some of this language is what we call <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/english-collocations/" title="English collocations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">collocations</a>, or natural combinations of words. We use collocations all the time. In fact, we store a collocation in our memory as one unit, rather than individual words.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve noticed a few collocations I’ve already used. Earlier, I said “financial records,” which are the documents related to a company’s finances. I also said “to tell the truth,” which is a verb plus noun, showing that collocations include combinations of different types of words. And if you learn these combinations, you can both understand better and sound more fluent. </p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll hear a conversation between Ray and Elaine, who work for an international company that has just gone through an audit. Ray is the CFO, or Chief Financial Officer, and Elaine is the CEO. In their conversation about the audit results, they use many collocations. We’ll explain these collocations later in the debrief. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	Ray says that the “audit findings” revealed a gap. What financial process is this gap related to?<br />
2.	What question does Elaine ask about reporting?<br />
3.	What does Ray suggest rolling out this quarter to improve procedures?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson, the first in a two-part series on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/finance-accounting/" title="English for Accounting and Finance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial English</a> for discussing an audit.</p>
<p>Financial audits have a way of increasing stress within a company. Suddenly everyone’s paying attention as reports get checked, numbers are reviewed, and details that seemed minor yesterday become urgent today. Audits can feel intense, but they are a critical part of good business practice.</p>
<p>Like many other financial processes, the world of audits has its own language or vocabulary. And much of this language comes in the form of “collocations.” Collocations are words that go together naturally. They are combinations of words that we learn as a group, rather than individually.</p>
<p>For example, a minute ago I said “everyone suddenly pays attention.” We always use that verb “pay” with the noun “attention.” It’s a strong collocation. That expression includes a verb and a noun, but collocations can feature any word forms. “For example” is a collocation that has a preposition and a noun, for example.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll hear a conversation between Ray and Marcia. Ray is the Chief Financial Officer for an international company. Marcia is an auditor with an accounting firm hired to do an audit of Ray’s company. During their conversation about the upcoming audit, Ray and Marcia use many English collocations. We’ll explain these collocations later in the debrief. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does Ray hope to do in the week following the 15th of the month?<br />
2.	What does Marcia want to “walk through,” or review, with Ray?<br />
3.	Ray asks about something that is a hot topic, in Marcia’s opinion. What does he ask about?</p>

<p>In this <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> News lesson on the effects of tariffs on global trade, we look at business English vocabulary related to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/it-and-computers/" title="English for IT" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the global supply chain and economics</a>.</p>
<p>With his recent moves, Donald Trump has plunged the global economy into a new era of mercantile competition. He slapped tariffs on numerous trading partners even as he finalized new deals with others, such as Japan and the EU. The US president’s executive order last month announcing the tariffs said they were designed to reduce America’s trade deficit. As the Washington Post reports:</p>
<p>Since returning to office, Trump has raised US tariffs to their highest level since the 1930s, with an average rate of about 17% on nearly 45% of all imports. New 25% tariffs have been announced on India, with 50% on Brazil and copper imports. Although the administration has signed framework deals with key partners such as the EU and Japan, analysts warn these agreements remain fragile and insufficient to offset rising input costs and legal challenges.</p>
<p>The consequences of these sweeping tariff increases are being felt deep within the mechanics of global trade. As costs rise and agreements remain uncertain, businesses are struggling to maintain operational stability. Nowhere is this more evident than in global supply chains.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on  how to keep a conversation going while <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/socializing/" title="socializing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">socializing at work</a>.</p>
<p>Some people are natural talkers. They seem to be able to start conversations, and maintain conversations, so easily. You might think this is an ability people are born with. Either you have it or you don’t. Either you have a social personality, or you don’t. But conversation is actually a skill.</p>
<p>And if conversation is a skill, then you can develop it through practice. In our last lesson, we practiced starting a conversation with someone. Once you’ve got the conversation started, it sure is uncomfortable if you don’t know how to keep it going. So we need a different set of skills and language to maintain the flow of conversation.</p>
<p>One thing you might do in this situation is direct the conversation or change the topic. And to keep the other person engaged, you’ll want to show interest and comment on what they’re saying. That makes them feel good and want to keep the conversation going. Showing interest often means asking follow-up questions and showing empathy or personal care or attention.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’re going to go back to the first dialog we heard in the previous lesson, which featured Penny and George. Penny and George work for an international company called Multi-Fresh, which is hosting a conference for its employees. We’ll hear how Penny develops her conversation with George.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What is the word or topic that Penny uses to change the topic of conversation?<br />
2.	What experience of George’s does Penny show interest in?<br />
3.	How does Penny react when George tells her about how difficult his experience was?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on how to start a conversation while <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/socializing/" title="English Conversation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">socializing</a> at work.</p>
<p>For many people, starting a conversation with someone can be a huge challenge. And it doesn’t get any easier when you’re doing this in another language! But it is one of the most important skills for building professional connections. A simple chat at a conference or event can lead to new opportunities, ideas, or contacts helpful for your career. </p>
<p>Learning to network confidently will help you feel more comfortable and prepared in professional and social situations. So what are some of the things you should think about? Well, you might start by introducing yourself, especially to someone you recognize but haven’t met in person before. You might also use questions to break the ice and start a conversation on a simple and safe topic.   </p>
<p>Informal conversations can be tricky. For one thing, you need to know how to handle a situation where you forget someone’s name. You also need to be able to find ways to keep a conversation going and, when the situation calls for it, end it politely.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll hear two dialogs that take place at an HR conference for an international company called Multi-Fresh. In the first dialog, we’ll hear Penny strike up a conversation with George. In the second dialog, Pat tries to strike up a conversation with George.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What information does Penny give when she introduces herself to George?<br />
2.	What topic does Penny mention to get the conversation started?<br />
3.	What excuse does George give for finishing his conversation with Pat?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on how to manage the discussion during a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/meetings/" title="meeting English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meeting in English</a>.</p>
<p>Bad meetings can waste time and leave everyone confused. But a well-run meeting can help create new ideas, solve problems, and move a project forward. Running a great meeting is about more than just following an agenda. It means guiding the conversation effectively.</p>
<p>If you’re running <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2017/03/04/business-english-pod-bep-300-external-meetings-in-english-1/" title="BEP 300 – External Meetings in English (Part 1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">formal meetings</a> as a manager or team leader, this skill is essential. But even if just you’re a team member who wants to make sure your team has good discussions, it’s good to understand what’s behind running a meeting. And you never know when it might be your job to facilitate.</p>
<p>Good meeting management often means keeping the discussion focused and inviting different viewpoints or <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/samples/bep-327-expressing-opinions/" title="BEP 327 – Expressing Opinions in English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opinions</a>. It also means widening the discussion, moving to a new agenda item, and checking for agreement.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll rejoin a meeting about budget cuts at an international shipping company. Martin, the General Manager, is facilitating the meeting. We’ll also hear Sandra, Sam, and David, three employees in the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	How does Martin respond to Sam’s comment about pizza?<br />
2.	What does Martin say once they have finished talking about the outsourcing issue?<br />
3.	At the end of the conversation, what question does Martin ask everyone if they agree on?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on how to start a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/meetings/" title="meeting English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meeting in English</a>.</p>
<p>Many jobs require us to spend a lot of time in meetings. Sometimes we might think there are too many meetings. In part, we might feel this way because a lot of meetings aren’t run very well or facilitated effectively.</p>
<p>There’s a good chance that you will have to run meetings some day, if you don’t already. You have a chance to make sure those meetings are effective by running the meeting well. Fortunately, running a meeting involves skills that you can learn.</p>
<p>Today we’ll focus on starting a meeting, which begins with getting people’s attention and acknowledging them. Next, you might clearly state the purpose or goals of the meeting before reviewing the agenda with everyone. Then you may invite someone to begin speaking about the first item on the agenda.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll hear the start of a meeting about budget cuts at an international shipping company. The meeting is being led by Martin, the General Manager. We’ll also hear Sandra, David, and Sam, employees who are attending the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does Martin apologize for as he is acknowledging the meeting attendees?<br />
2.	What does Martin say is the objective of the meeting?<br />
3.	What does Martin invite Sandra to do at the end of the conversation?</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we look at how to build a collaborative workplace culture.</p>
<p>Even in the most competitive companies, collaboration is key to success. In our <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2025/05/11/skills-360-fostering-collaboration-1/" title="Skills 360 - Fostering a Culture of Collaboration (1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last lesson</a>, we looked at the benefits of collaboration, like innovation and employee engagement. Now we&#8217;ll look at the systems and approaches to make it happen.</p>
<p>Collaboration starts with leadership. Leaders need to focus on “we,” not “I.” That means trusting their teams, being open about goals and challenges, and involving others in decisions. When teams feel trusted and included, they’re more likely to work together.</p>
<p>Communication is key too &#8211; and it changes when you give up control. It’s no longer just about giving clear instructions. It’s about listening, understanding different ideas, and building consensus. That takes more time and effort, which means teams need some flexibility in their schedules.</p>
<p>Collaboration also needs structure. Cross-functional teams, shared roles, and communities of practice all help break down silos. And digital tools like Slack or project management platforms make it easier to share work and ideas.</p>
<p>Of course, not every decision has to be made as a group. Some are simple or urgent. And when trust is low, it may be best to focus on rebuilding that first.</p>
<p>But if you want the real benefits of collaboration, you need to create the right environment: one built on trust, open communication, and the systems to support teamwork.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we look at how to build a culture of collaboration at work.</p>
<p>Collaboration is more than just working together or coordinating tasks. It means people share goals, ideas, decisions, and responsibility. True collaboration often involves people from different teams coming together to solve shared problems or create something new.</p>
<p>So why is collaboration so important? One key reason is innovation. When people with different backgrounds and skills come together, they bring fresh ideas. These creative clashes often lead to breakthroughs. Collaboration also helps spread knowledge across teams. If one team finds a better way to work, others can learn from it &#8211; if they’re connected.</p>
<p>Stronger connections also lead to greater resilience. When teams share skills and experiences, they can support each other when challenges come up. And beyond business results, collaboration boosts employee engagement. People feel more connected, valued, and motivated when they work toward shared goals.</p>
<p>But collaboration takes effort. It’s not instant or easy. It takes time, trust, and a willingness to share control. If you want others’ input, you have to be open to their ideas, not just your own.</p>
<p>Collaboration can bring big rewards, but it also comes with challenges. In part two, we’ll explore what teams and leaders can do to support collaboration through strong communication, trust, and the right systems.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on <a title="English for purchasing" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/purchasing-english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English for purchasing</a>. This lesson looks at language for evaluating proposals from vendors.</p>
<p>Business is all about buying and selling. And just as your company sells products to individual consumers or other companies, you also have to purchase goods and services to make it all happen. For ongoing purchasing relationships, this means evaluating different vendors to find the best match.</p>
<p>So, when you sit with your team to evaluate vendor proposals, what will you talk about? These discussions often involve comparing pricing, timelines, quality, and service. You might also talk about warranties, reliability, and risks. And just like any group process, the quality of the decision will come down not just to the facts in front of you, but your ability to communicate clearly about them.</p>
<p>In conversations about vendor proposals, there are several aspects you might consider. You might assess risk as well as vendor capacity. You might also evaluate the total cost and compare value, as opposed to the basic contract price. And finally, you might prioritize the different criteria you use to assess the vendors.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a conversation between managers at a fitness equipment company called xFit.

This lesson looks at language for evaluating proposals from vendors. Business is all about buying and selling. And just as your company sells products to individual consumers or other companies, you also have to purchase goods and services to make it all happen. For ongoing purchasing relationships, this means evaluating different vendors to find the best match. So, when you sit with your team to evaluate vendor proposals, what will you talk about? These discussions often involve comparing pricing, timelines, quality, and service. You might also talk about warranties, reliability, and risks. And just like any group process, the quality of the decision will come down not just to the facts in front of you, but your ability to communicate clearly about them. In conversations about vendor proposals, there are several aspects you might consider. You might assess risk as well as vendor capacity. You might also evaluate the total cost and compare value, as opposed to the basic contract price. And finally, you might prioritize the different criteria you use to assess the vendors. In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a conversation between managers at a fitness equipment company called xFit. Hazel, Adam, and Nick are evaluating proposals to choose a manufacturer of a specific part for their line of treadmills. In previous lessons on purchasing, we heard xFit choose a company called VinMech to produce a part for a different exercise machine. Listening Questions 1.

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on the skills you need to succeed in a first-round job <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/job-interviews/" title="interview in English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview in English</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/job-interviews/" title="job interview English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">job interview</a> is a chance to highlight your achievements and talk about the amazing things you’ve done in your career. By talking about what you’ve achieved, you can show how your experience fits the position. And by showing how your strengths have helped you, you can convince the interviewer that you’re the right person to hire.</p>
<p>If only it were that easy, though! Interviewers aren’t going to ask you only about the good stuff. They’re going to ask about difficult things as well. That means they might ask you about problems in your current or past jobs. And they might also ask you that dreaded question: what are your weaknesses?</p>
<p>But don’t worry. You know these questions are coming, so you can get ready. Think of some difficult situations you’ve been in. Focus on the ones where you were able to solve a problem or deal with difficult people. And think about your weaknesses honestly, and how you’ve tried to improve on these things. In that way, you’ll be able to face the tough questions confidently. </p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll rejoin William as he interviews for a position at a bank in Hong Kong. William is being interviewed by Mike, an HR manager at the bank. You will hear how William deals with <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2016/07/02/business-english-pod-290-advanced-english-skills-2-dealing-with-difficult-questions/" title="BEP 290 – English Interview Skills 2: Handling Difficult Questions">difficult questions</a>, and how he isn’t afraid to discuss problems and how he dealt with them.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	William talks about a problem with short-term loans. What does he say was the cause of this problem?<br />
2.	What does William say is one of his strengths?<br />
3.	What does William say is one of his weaknesses?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on key skills for a first-round job <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/job-interviews/" title="interview in English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview in English</a>.</p>
<p>If you find <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/job-interviews/" title="interview English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">job interviews</a> stressful, you’re certainly not alone. Many people struggle to feel confident and comfortable in interview situations. And there’s the added worry that the stress you feel will make it even more difficult to answer the questions well. But you can reduce this stress with effective preparation. </p>
<p>You know that you’ll be asked certain types of questions. So you can make notes about your responses, or make an outline of important ideas that you want to talk about. You can also develop skills to make sure you’re being clear and accurate in your responses. </p>
<p>So what should you prepare and what skills should you develop? Well, for starters, you should be ready to introduce yourself and your career path, and to summarize your current job responsibilities. In terms of skills, it’s good to practice clarifying the words you use, buying yourself time, and connecting your answers back to the question.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll listen as William is interviewed for a position in business development at a bank in Hong Kong. He’s being interviewed by Mike, an HR manager at the company. This is a first-round interview, and you can hear William show how comfortable and skilled he is at responding to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What information does William give about his education and work history?<br />
2.	What does William say about his management style?<br />
3.	What does William say to buy himself time to think of an answer?</p>

If you find job interviews stressful, you’re certainly not alone. Many people struggle to feel confident and comfortable in interview situations. And there’s the added worry that the stress you feel will make it even more difficult to answer the questions well. But you can reduce this stress with effective preparation. You know that you’ll be asked certain types of questions. So you can make notes about your responses, or make an outline of important ideas that you want to talk about. You can also develop skills to make sure you’re being clear and accurate in your responses. So what should you prepare and what skills should you develop? Well, for starters, you should be ready to introduce yourself and your career path, and to summarize your current job responsibilities.

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for the second part of our series on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/business-idioms/" title="business English idioms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English idioms</a> related to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/it-and-computers/" title="technology English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">technology</a>.</p>
<p>Every day you use dozens of high-tech devices and apps to communicate, plan, organize, monitor and store information. It’s almost impossible to imagine the workplace before modern technology. It’s also almost impossible to imagine the English language without all the idioms we use related to technology. </p>
<p>If you want to be on the same wavelength as expert English speakers, you can’t ignore idioms. And I just used a prime example there. If you are “on the same wavelength,” it means you understand each other. This comes from radio technology, where you have to be tuned to the same frequency to receive a signal. </p>
<p>As you can see, an idiom has a special meaning that isn’t always clear. You can think about the words on their own, but that won’t help you. You need to learn idioms as chunks of language, with a special meaning beyond the individual words. In this way, you will be able to communicate even better in English.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll rejoin a conversation at an engineering company between Maggie, Antonio, and Finn. They are <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2025/02/02/bep-412-business-english-idioms-about-technology-1/" title="BEP 412 – Business English Idioms about Technology (1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continuing their conversation</a> about upgrading the tech systems in their company. In their discussion, they use many idioms related to technology. See if you can spot some of these, and we’ll explain them later in the debrief.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does Antonio say about HR and their training plans?<br />
2.	Why didn’t the company move to PayWorks software a couple of years ago?<br />
3.	How does Antonio describe the new servers that are available?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/business-idioms/" title="business English idioms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">business English idioms</a> related to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/it-and-computers/" title="English for IT" rel="noopener" target="_blank">technology</a>.</p>
<p>The world of tech has given rise to a host of new <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/vocabulary/" title="business English vocabulary" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vocabulary</a> and terminology. Think about a phrase like “to reboot,” which originally referred to restarting a computer but is now commonly used to mean starting over in any context. Idioms like that highlight how mastering language goes beyond just grammar.</p>
<p>Indeed, many language learners spend a lot of time trying to figure out the nuts and bolts of a language. By that I mean the grammar, writing system, sounds, and basic vocabulary of a language. The thing is, once we’ve got the nuts and bolts, it can feel like our progress stalls. Getting to the next level requires you to move beyond basic vocabulary and master expressions like idioms.</p>
<p>For example, a second ago, I mentioned the “nuts and bolts” of language. Nuts and bolts are a way of connecting things made of metal. So why am I using those words when I talk about language? Because “nuts and bolts” is used as an idiom to refer to the basic parts or pieces of something. And with technology as such an important part of our lives, it’s no wonder we have so many English idioms related to technology.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll listen to a conversation at an engineering company. The company is led by Maggie, Antonio, and Finn. They’re talking about how the growth in their company requires upgrades to all their tech systems. In their discussion, they use many idioms related to technology. See if you can spot some of these, and we’ll explain them later in the debrief.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	Near the start of the meeting, what does Finn say he wants to avoid doing?<br />
2.	What does Maggie worry might happen if they don’t improve or “level up” their tech systems?<br />
3.	What does Antonio say the company did with Zoom not long ago?</p>

	<author>businessenglishpod@mac.com (www.BusinessEnglishPod.com)</author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle>https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/bizpod/BEP-412-Technology-Idioms-1.mp3 Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on business English idioms related to technology. The world of tech has given rise to a host of new vocabulary and terminology. Think about a phrase like “to reboot,” which originally referred to restarting a computer but is now commonly used to mean starting over in any context. Idioms like that highlight how mastering language goes beyond just grammar. Indeed, many language learners spend a lot of time trying to figure out the nuts and bolts of a language. By that I mean the grammar, writing system, sounds, and basic vocabulary of a language. The thing is, once we’ve got the nuts and bolts, it can feel like our progress stalls. Getting to the next level requires you to move beyond basic vocabulary and master expressions like idioms. For example, a second ago, I mentioned the “nuts and bolts” of language. Nuts and bolts are a way of connecting things made of metal. So why am I using those words when I talk about language? Because “nuts and bolts” is used as an idiom to refer to the basic parts or pieces of something. And with technology as such an important part of our lives, it’s no wonder we have so many English idioms related to technology. In this lesson, we’ll listen to a conversation at an engineering company. The company is led by Maggie, Antonio, and Finn. They’re talking about how the growth in their company requires upgrades to all their tech systems. In their discussion, they use many idioms related to technology. See if you can spot some of these, and we’ll explain them later in the debrief. Listening Questions 1. Near the start of the meeting, what does Finn say he wants to avoid doing? 2. What does Maggie worry might happen if they don’t improve or “level up” their tech systems? 3. What does Antonio say the company did with Zoom not long ago?

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we continue our look at <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/job-interviews/" title="advanced interview skills" rel="noopener" target="_blank">advanced interview skills</a> for interviewing and hiring the right people.</p>
<p>Effective <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2013/02/10/bep-225-conducting-a-job-interview-in-english-1/" title="BEP 225 – Conducting a Job Interview in English (1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interviewing</a>  is essential for finding the right candidate. That&#8217;s not just someone with the right qualifications but also the right mindset and skills for long-term success. Beyond education and experience, advanced interviewing techniques can help identify critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and workplace compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight on Critical Thinking</strong><br />
Critical thinking is a vital 21st-century skill that isn’t always listed in job descriptions. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and making logical inferences &#8211; all crucial in today’s fast-paced work environments. To assess this, use scenario-based questions tailored to the role. For instance, ask: “You are tasked with creating a low-budget marketing campaign. What steps would you take to ensure its success?” Such questions delve deeper than generic prompts, revealing a candidate’s thought process and creativity.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge-Specific Questions</strong><br />
Understanding how candidates handle challenges is key to gauging their suitability. Ask direct questions about common role-specific difficulties. For example: “This role involves tight deadlines. How do you manage pressure?” Responses can reveal practical strategies and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Workplace Compatibility</strong><br />
Discuss workplace setups—whether hybrid, remote, or in-office—and ask how candidates thrive in these environments. Instead of a simple yes/no question about preferences, explore strategies they’ve used to succeed in similar settings. This helps you understand whether they’ll adapt to your unique work culture.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Goals</strong><br />
Assessing a candidate’s career aspirations ensures alignment between their goals and the role. Questions like “Where do you see yourself in five years?” can clarify whether the position supports their professional journey.</p>
<p>With rising costs, fierce competition, and high turnover, effective interviewing is more critical than ever. By evaluating critical thinking, adaptability, and alignment with your workplace, you’ll make informed hiring decisions that benefit both the candidate and your company.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we look at <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/job-interviews/" title="advanced interview skills" rel="noopener" target="_blank">advanced interview skills</a> for interviewing and hiring the best staff.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2013/02/10/bep-225-conducting-a-job-interview-in-english-1/" title="BEP 225 – Conducting a Job Interview in English (1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Interviewing</a> effectively is a skill that goes beyond asking common questions &#8211; it&#8217;s about uncovering the ideal candidate who fits both the role and the organization’s culture. Here’s how to elevate your interviewing game.</p>
<p><strong>Start with Fit</strong><br />
Interviewing isn’t just about verifying skills; it’s about evaluating fit. A candidate may have the right experience but still might not align with your company’s values, mission, or work style. Frame your questions around this concept. For instance, “Can you describe a workplace where you felt most productive?” helps identify if their preferences match your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Values Matter</strong><br />
Understanding a candidate’s values is key to predicting how they’ll integrate into the team. Ask open-ended questions like, “What motivates you most in your work?” or “What does success look like to you?” Such questions provide deeper insights into their core drivers and compatibility with your organization’s culture.</p>
<p><strong>Assess Soft Skills During the Interview</strong><br />
Strong soft skills such as <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/communication-skills/" title="English communication" rel="noopener" target="_blank">communication</a>, collaboration, and <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2024/08/25/skills-360-problem-solving-1-developing-the-right-skills/" title="problem-solving" rel="noopener" target="_blank">problem-solving</a> often make the difference in team performance. Use the interview to dig deeper: ask candidates to share examples of handling conflicts or overcoming challenges. Observe their responses for clarity, tone, and adaptability. This will help you gauge their interpersonal and emotional intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Build Rapport without Bias</strong><br />
Creating a comfortable environment helps candidates show their true selves. Begin with job-related small talk, avoiding potentially sensitive topics like family or health. Remember, rapport shouldn’t overshadow diversity. A hiring panel with varied perspectives can provide valuable insights and help <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2024/06/09/skills-360-how-to-overcome-cognitive-bias/" title="cognitive bias">counter biases</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Adopt Fair Practices</strong><br />
Blind screening of resumes and consistent, structured interview questions can mitigate bias and ensure objectivity. This approach prioritizes finding the most qualified candidate rather than the one who interviews most smoothly.</p>
<p>Ultimately, an effective interview isn’t about who you personally like most &#8211; it’s about finding evidence of alignment with the job, the team, and the company. Perfecting your interviewing strategy is the foundation of successful hiring.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/project-management/" title="English for Project Managers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Project management</a> isn’t just for people who consider themselves a “project manager.” No matter what kind of work you do, you’ll likely have to lead or participate in some kind of project. And if you are a project manager, then today’s lesson is particularly important.</p>
<p> Reporting on progress can happen in various settings, ranging from formal meetings with stakeholders to more casual interactions, like a quick chat at the water cooler or over a coffee. While the tone and format may differ, the core principles remain the same. Effective communication in these moments is crucial to keep everyone aligned and ensure no details slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>For example, you’ll likely want to ask for an update and confirm key details. You’ll also have to identify follow-up actions, assign responsibility, and establish clear deadlines. Ultimately, strong reporting and follow-up skills are essential to fostering accountability and driving projects to successful completion.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll hear a project manager named Rudi giving updates to his boss, Wolfgang. They work for a company that maintains and modifies jetways, the bridges that connect airplanes to the airport gates. They’ve been working on a project to modify jetways at an airport for a large type of plane called an A380.  </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	How does Wolfgang respond to the possible problem that Joe has identified?<br />
2.	What actions does Wolfgang ask Rudi to take after he mentions Joe’s solution?<br />
3.	After they discuss costs and budget, what topic does Wolfgang ask about near the end of the conversation?</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English">Business English</a> Pod for today’s lesson, the second in our series on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2024/11/10/bep-410-mergers-discussing-an-integration-plan-1/" title="BEP 410 – Mergers: Discussing an Integration Plan (1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">integrating the operations</a> of two companies. These lessons will focus on discussions about how to merge, or integrate, companies and operations.</p>
<p>Mergers can bring enormous benefits to corporations. They can lead to greater efficiency, greater market share, greater value, and greater access to talent. But there are a thousand and one things that might get in the way of a successful integration. And to overcome these potential roadblocks, you need a strategic approach.</p>
<p>Mergers are part negotiation. Your company has a lot to gain, but you can’t sign everything away too easily. For that reason, you may find it important to assert your position at crucial times and to emphasize issues you consider critical.</p>
<p>In taking a strategic approach, it’s also important to identify those big challenges or roadblocks I mentioned. Once you’ve done that, you can address these challenges. And it’s always helpful if one of the companies has gone through a merger before. In that case, you can reference prior experience as you plan the integration.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll rejoin a conversation between two Chief Operating Officers of companies that are planning to merge. Michelle and Alex are discussing how the integration will happen and addressing challenges along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What major challenge does Michelle identify related to integrating the IT systems?<br />
2.	What particular issue does Michelle emphasize needs to be considered besides technical issues?<br />
3.	What does Alex suggest to counteract worries about people leaving the company?</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English Pod">Business English Pod</a> for today’s lesson, the first in our series on integrating the operations of two companies. These lessons will focus on the conversations we have when talking about how to merge or integrate companies and operations.</p>
<p>There’s an old saying that strategy is 95% implementation. There’s no better proof of this than in the merging of companies. Coming to terms on a buy-out is difficult in and of itself. But once the agreement has been made, there’s the incredibly difficult work of making it happen.</p>
<p>Integrating companies requires us to think and talk about every aspect of business, from the nuts and bolts of accounting to the fuzzy aspects of culture. There’s a lot at stake, not just for the owners but for every single person who works for the two companies.</p>
<p>In discussing an integration, it’s important to lay out a clear timeline and to build in feedback mechanisms to ensure things go as smoothly as possible. You will have to bring up concerns effectively and suggest ways to smooth the transition. And you may find yourself referring back to previous agreements as you work out all the details.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a conversation between Alex and Michelle, two Chief Operating Officers. Alex’s company has just bought out Michelle’s company, and they’re meeting to discuss how the integration will roll out.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What concern does Michelle raise after Alex lays out a possible timeline?<br />
2.	What previous agreement does Michelle refer to?<br />
3.	What does Alex suggest to ensure a smoother leadership transition?</p>

<p>In this <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> News lesson on recent hiring trends, we look at business English vocabulary related to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/human-resources/" title="English for HR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">human resources</a> and recruitment.</p>
<p>The world of HR is radically different than it was just five years ago. Today, we’re seeing unprecedented movement in the workforce. And as companies compete to recruit and retain talent, several key trends have emerged. One relates to how we evaluate potential recruits, as Forbes explains:</p>
<p>Skill-based hiring is all the rage these days. Companies are moving away from relying solely on degrees and traditional qualifications, instead zeroing in on the specific skills candidates bring to the table. It makes sense, especially in industries where the pace of change is relentless. Skills are easier to match with job requirements, and with AI playing a bigger role in recruitment, it&#8217;s more efficient to identify those who can hit the ground running.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for the second part of our lesson on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/presentations/" title="English for Presentations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English for presentations</a> and handling a question and answer session at the end of a presentation.</p>
<p>Presentations can be stressful. Speaking in front of the public, or even just your colleagues, makes even confident people nervous. And there’s one part of a presentation in particular that might dial up the nerves: the questions people ask at the end of your presentation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2024/09/22/bep-36c-english-for-presentations-questions-and-answers-1/" title="English for Presentations: Questions and Answers (1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Q&#038;A</a> requires you to think on your feet. Some of the questions you get might be really difficult. And for that reason, it may be important to check that your answers are sufficient for the question-asker. At the same time, the questions might not even be relevant! So you’ll need a strategy for that situation as well.</p>
<p>Sometimes a person will ask a question that you think you’re not the best person to answer. In that case, you can figure out who to redirect the question to. And if this entire Q&#038;A situation is stressful, well at least you have some control. You can control the timing, instead of letting it go on forever.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll continue listening to a Q&#038;A in a meeting at a steel company. Nick, a sales director, has just given a presentation. He and his boss Max are dealing with questions from Bryan and Cindy. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	After telling Cindy about measures of success, what question does Nick ask her?<br />
2.	What does Max say about Cindy’s question regarding morale and how the sales staff are feeling?<br />
3.	How does Nick respond to John’s question about marketing in the U.K.?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on how to deal with the question and answer session at the end of a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/presentations/" title="English for Presentations | Presentation in English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">presentation in English</a>. </p>
<p>A presentation can be planned, organized, scripted, and rehearsed. But that’s simply not possible with the questions you might get at the end of your presentation. Sure, you can try to anticipate what people might ask, but you never really know. They may refer to specific points in your presentation and challenge you on these points.</p>
<p>For this reason, you need the skills to handle whatever you&#8217;re faced with. And sometimes that means overcoming doubt or resistance to your ideas. You might have to use buffers to deal with tough questions and concede certain points to your audience. You may also find yourself clarifying a point and paraphrasing your audience’s questions.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll listen to the Q&#038;A following a presentation in English by Nick, a sales director for a steel company. Bryan and Cindy are posing some difficult questions. Nick, and his boss Max, are using several techniques for dealing with these questions. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	How does Nick respond at first when Bryan asks a tough question about the survey results?<br />
2.	Cindy begins to ask a question about retraining the salespeople. What does Nick say to clarify what he meant?<br />
3.	How does Nick deal with Cindy’s question about measuring success?</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we continue our look at problem-solving. In this lesson, we’ll focus on the process of solving problems.</p>
<p>As we talked about in our last lesson, the first step in <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2024/08/25/skills-360-problem-solving-1-developing-the-right-skills/" title="Problem-Solving 1: Developing the Right Skills" rel="noopener" target="_blank">problem-solving</a> is analysis. This means gathering all the relevant information and understanding the problem’s causes. It’s important to look at the situation from different perspectives and ensure that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the issue. Without this, you risk coming up with solutions that aren’t feasible or acceptable.</p>
<p>Once the problem is understood, the next step is to define your goals. Many people skip this, but it’s essential to clarify what a good solution would look like. Set clear guidelines, including your timeline, budget, and who is responsible for what. This ensures everyone is aligned and focused on the same objectives.</p>

Encourage creativity and seek input from a variety of people. It’s important to separate the generation of ideas from the evaluation. Don’t judge ideas too quickly, just focus on coming up with as many as possible. This will give you a broad range of options to choose from later.</p>
<p>After generating ideas, it’s time to evaluate and select the best solution. The “best” solution is the one that fits the goals and criteria you set earlier. Remember, there’s no perfect solution, only the most practical and effective given the circumstances. Make sure the chosen solution is something everyone can support.</p>
<p>Finally, the last step is evaluation. After implementing the solution, take time to reflect. Did it work as expected? Could anything have been done differently? This reflection helps improve your problem-solving process and prepares you for future challenges.</p>
<p>Problem-solving requires a clear, structured approach. By following these five steps &#8211; analysis, goal-setting, brainstorming, decision-making, and evaluation &#8211; you can tackle problems more effectively and find the optimal solution.</p>

In this lesson, we’ll focus on the process of solving problems. As we talked about in our last lesson, the first step in problem-solving is analysis. This means gathering all the relevant information and understanding the problem’s causes. It’s important to look at the situation from different perspectives and ensure that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the issue. Without this, you risk coming up with solutions that aren’t feasible or acceptable. Once the problem is understood, the next step is to define your goals. Many people skip this, but it’s essential to clarify what a good solution would look like. Set clear guidelines, including your timeline, budget, and who is responsible for what. This ensures everyone is aligned and focused on the same objectives. Now, you can move on to brainstorming possible solutions. Encourage creativity and seek input from a variety of people.

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we look at solving problems. In this lesson, we’ll focus on the skills you need to solve problems.</p>
<p>Problems are an unavoidable part of life and work, and in business, your ability to solve them is critical. Fortunately, problem-solving skills can be developed.</p>
<p>The first key skill is analytical thinking. Instead of trying to come up with any old solution, take time to thoroughly understand the problem. What caused it? Can it be broken down into parts? Analyzing a problem requires critical thinking, which helps you understand connections, prioritize, and identify patterns.</p>
<p>Next is creativity, which involves looking at the problem from different perspectives and asking open-ended questions. Creativity, paired with analytical skills, leads to innovative solutions, as it helps you break free from conventional thinking. However, trial and error is often part of the process, and that’s where resilience comes in. Resilience is the ability to stay focused and calm when problems get tough. It’s about persevering, even when your first idea doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Collaboration is another crucial skill, as problem-solving often involves working with others. Effective communication and emotional intelligence are vital in navigating complex group dynamics, especially when tensions are high. Finally, decisiveness is essential to avoid getting stuck in &#8220;analysis paralysis.&#8221; Making decisions, even with limited information, is crucial for moving forward.</p>
<p>Developing these skills &#8211; analysis, creativity, resilience, collaboration, and decisiveness &#8211; will significantly enhance your problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p>In this <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> News lesson on the resurgence of robots, we look at business English vocabulary related to robotics and <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/it-and-computers/" title="English for tech" rel="noopener" target="_blank">technology</a>.</p>
<p>While generative AI has been grabbing the headlines lately, the world of robotics has been developing at a rapid clip. The robot industry has been expanding exponentially, albeit mainly outside the spotlight of the mass media. And, as MSN explains, business is booming:</p>
<p>According to an announcement by the International Federation of Robotics, the stock of operational robots around the world has now reached 3.5 million units, and the value of installations has reached an estimated $16 billion. According to the Federation, robotics now plays a fundamental role in the changing demands of manufacturers around the world. </p>
<p>Of course, talk of robots will immediately call to mind automotive manufacturing, and car-makers were certainly one of the earliest adopters. But it’s not just the automotive industry anymore. Robots are being deployed on smaller scales, alongside humans, outside of assembly-line manufacturing. Robots have found applications throughout the economy, for companies big and small.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English Pod">Business English Pod</a> for today’s lesson, the second in a two-part series on <a title="BEP 408 – Quality Control 1: Manufacturing" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2024/06/23/bep-408-quality-control-1-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quality control</a>. In this lesson, we’ll focus on quality control for <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/customer-service-english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer service</a>.</p>
<p>For companies that sell products, quality control is critical. Not just for ensuring consistency, safety, and reliability, but for meeting customers’ expectations. When customers buy from your company, they’re thinking about more than just the product itself. They’re thinking about how well you serve them.</p>
<p>Customer service involves a huge range of activities. Pretty much any time a customer interacts with a person or a system in your company, it’s customer service. And you need to think about everything from how easy it is to use the website, to the tone your employees use on the phone.</p>
<p>When we talk about customer service, and the quality of customer service, there are many special expressions we use. Many of these are combinations of words that we call “collocations.” You might often learn individual vocabulary words, but we don’t always think, or speak, in individual words. We speak in chunks of language. These chunks are called collocations. In fact “customer service” itself is a collocation. Those two words go together to create a new idea.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll continue a conversation between Emma and Paolo. Emma is a consultant that helps companies with quality control. And Paolo runs a company that makes and services solar panels. As they discuss the work that Emma will do for Paolo’s company, they use many English collocations. We’ll explain those collocations later in the debrief.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1. What two goals does Paolo have regarding customer service quality?<br />
2. What does Paolo’s company do after every install or service call?<br />
3. What has Paolo’s company not done yet, in a documented way?</p>

In this lesson, we’ll focus on quality control for customer service. For companies that sell products, quality control is critical. Not just for ensuring consistency, safety, and reliability, but for meeting customers’ expectations. When customers buy from your company, they’re thinking about more than just the product itself. They’re thinking about how well you serve them. Customer service involves a huge range of activities. Pretty much any time a customer interacts with a person or a system in your company, it’s customer service. And you need to think about everything from how easy it is to use the website, to the tone your employees use on the phone. When we talk about customer service, and the quality of customer service, there are many special expressions we use. Many of these are combinations of words that we call “collocations.” You might often learn individual vocabulary words, but we don’t always think, or speak, in individual words. We speak in chunks of language. These chunks are called collocations. In fact “customer service” itself is a collocation. Those two words go together to create a new idea. In today’s dialog, we’ll continue a conversation between Emma and Paolo. Emma is a consultant that helps companies with quality control. And Paolo runs a company that makes and services solar panels. As they discuss the work that Emma will do for Paolo’s company, they use many English collocations. We’ll explain those collocations later in the debrief. Listening Questions 1. What two goals does Paolo have regarding customer service quality? 2. What does Paolo’s company do after every install or service call? 3. What has Paolo’s company not done yet, in a documented way?

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson, the first in a two-part series on quality control. In this lesson, we’ll focus on the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2016/03/08/video-vocab-47-business-english-vocabulary-manufacturing-1/" title="English Vocabulary for Manufacturing 1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">manufacturing</a> side of things.</p>
<p>Successful companies understand the importance of quality. At minimum, quality control is about meeting industry standards or regulations. Beyond that, quality is a huge factor in brand reputation and customer satisfaction. And a commitment to strong QC, or quality control, can also lead to significant cost savings.</p>
<p>Given these benefits, no wonder many companies have entire teams or positions dedicated to monitoring quality. And, just like any other area of expertise, quality control comes with its own special language. Much of this language appears in set expressions that we call “collocations.” In fact, I just used one when I mentioned “monitoring quality.” To monitor quality is a common collocation related to quality control.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/english-collocations/" title="English Collocations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Collocations</a> are just natural combinations of words. Certain verbs and adjectives always go with certain nouns. And certain nouns often combine to create a special meaning. If you just learn new words individually, you might miss these natural combinations.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll hear a conversation between Paolo and Emma. Paolo works for a company that manufactures, sells, and services solar panels. Emma is a quality control consultant. Paolo’s company is looking to hire Emma to conduct a quality control audit, or a review of their systems. During their conversation, they use lots of English collocations, which we’ll explain later in the debrief.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does Paolo say they did after completing a safety audit?<br />
2.	What kind of testing will Emma’s work not include?<br />
3.	What is the purpose of “pulling samples” in quality control?</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast as we continue learning about cognitive bias. In this lesson, we’ll look at how to deal with the biases that impact our decision-making.</p>
<p>Trusting your gut and making quick decisions might work in some cases. But if you think your decision-making ability is based on perfect reasoning and complete information, well you’re wrong. You’re only human after all. And your decision-making machinery is flawed. In our last lesson, we had a closer look at exactly the kinds of biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. So how can you overcome these biases?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a question that every good manager should be asking themselves. And making better decisions while avoiding biases comes down to a few key things: awareness, curiosity, and evidence. Let’s start with awareness. Now, if you tuned in to our last lesson when we talked about <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2024/05/26/skills-360-understanding-cognitive-bias/" title="Cognitive Bias" rel="noopener" target="_blank">different types of bias</a>, then you’re already on the right track.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast for today&#8217;s lesson on cognitive bias. These are factors that affect our ability to make good decisions and reasonable judgments.</p>
<p>Cognitive biases are factors that can negatively impact our decision-making and judgments. We make numerous decisions daily, ranging from significant ones like hiring employees to minor ones deciding where to go to lunch. These decisions often rely on intuition, information, and others&#8217; perspectives. However, biases, which are unconscious tendencies, can lead to suboptimal decisions.</p>
<p>One common bias is the confirmation bias, where we focus on information that supports our existing beliefs and ignore contradictory evidence. This can cause us to become entrenched in incorrect views. Another is the sunk-cost fallacy, where we stick to a decision due to prior investments, even when it&#8217;s not the best choice.</p>
<p>The halo effect and horns effect are biases where one trait of a person influences our overall perception of them, often leading to misjudgments. For example, attractiveness can be wrongly equated with competence, while negative traits can overshadow a person&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>Intuition can sometimes mislead us, making data crucial for decisions. However, biases like sample size neglect, where we draw conclusions from insufficient data, can still occur. Availability bias makes us overestimate the likelihood of recent events, such as fearing flying after hearing about a crash despite its relative safety.</p>
<p>The planning fallacy leads us to underestimate the time needed for tasks, often because we consider only the best-case scenarios. Recognizing these biases is the first step to mitigating their effects.</p>

These are factors that affect our ability to make good decisions and reasonable judgments. Cognitive biases are factors that can negatively impact our decision-making and judgments. We make numerous decisions daily, ranging from significant ones like hiring employees to minor ones deciding where to go to lunch. These decisions often rely on intuition, information, and others&amp;#8217; perspectives. However, biases, which are unconscious tendencies, can lead to suboptimal decisions. One common bias is the confirmation bias, where we focus on information that supports our existing beliefs and ignore contradictory evidence. This can cause us to become entrenched in incorrect views. Another is the sunk-cost fallacy, where we stick to a decision due to prior investments, even when it&amp;#8217;s not the best choice. The halo effect and horns effect are biases where one trait of a person influences our overall perception of them, often leading to misjudgments. For example, attractiveness can be wrongly equated with competence, while negative traits can overshadow a person&amp;#8217;s capabilities. Intuition can sometimes mislead us, making data crucial for decisions. However, biases like sample size neglect, where we draw conclusions from insufficient data, can still occur. Availability bias makes us overestimate the likelihood of recent events, such as fearing flying after hearing about a crash despite its relative safety. The planning fallacy leads us to underestimate the time needed for tasks, often because we consider only the best-case scenarios. Recognizing these biases is the first step to mitigating their effects.

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on clarifying in <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/meetings/" title="English meeting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English meetings</a>. Previously we looked at how to clarify what was said when you didn’t hear properly. Today we’re going to look at how to clarify what someone means in order to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Life would be simple if everyone said what they meant clearly and directly. But that’s not the way things work. People often speak indirectly or use words that are a bit confusing. For this reason, we often need to clarify what people mean.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do this. You can tell someone you don’t understand. Or you might confirm an idea or restate what someone says if you think you might understand. And it may take some time to work out the general meaning or the meaning of a specific word.</p>
<p>Today we’ll listen to a meeting between Michael, Rachel, and Ryan. Michael is leading the meeting and talking about the disappointing launch of a new product. During the conversation, it’s not always clear what people mean. For this reason, they use several different expressions for clarifying what was meant.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What expression does Michael use about the “numbers” that Ryan tries to clarify?<br />
2.	What does Ryan ask about that Michael wants to clarify?<br />
3.	What word does Michael use that Rachel asks about near the end of the conversation?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson, the fifth in our series on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/finance-accounting/" title="financial English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial English</a>. In this lesson, we’ll focus on selling a client on a new investment opportunity. </p>
<p>Some people would say that selling is all about convincing someone that they want or need what you’ve got. But that’s just half of it. A car salesman might convince you that you want a new car. But then he has to show you why his car is better than the others. And that it’s worth the money he’s asking. </p>
<p>Things get a little trickier when it comes to selling financial services. Investing isn&#8217;t just about the current value, but about how that value will grow in the future. So, compared to selling a car, there&#8217;s just a lot more at stake!</p>
<p>In this situation, you’ll need to do a good job of assessing risk and comparing an opportunity to other opportunities. You’ll also need to work with clients who’ve done some research. That means warning them against bad information and showing them alternatives. It also means reducing pressure on the client so that you don’t scare them off. </p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll rejoin a conversation between Robert, an investment advisor, and his client Jessica. Robert is attempting to sell an opportunity to Jessica and steer her away from bad information.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does Robert say is the difference in risk between a classic and an alternative hedge fund?<br />
2.	What does Robert say about corporate bonds after Jessica mentions that she’s read about them?<br />
3.	What does Robert suggest as an alternative to corporate bonds?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson, the fourth in our series on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/finance-accounting/" title="financial English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial English</a>. In this lesson, we’ll focus on pitching a new opportunity to a client.</p>
<p>In certain ways, <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2023/06/04/bep-397-english-for-sales-financial-services-1/" title="BEP 397 – English for Sales: Financial Services (1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">selling financial services</a> is just like selling any other kind of product. You connect with people and you match your solution to their needs or desires. And, of course, you show how that solution is worth the money it costs. But with financial services, these activities are usually much higher stakes. </p>
<p>Working with other people’s money requires you to work on maintaining a strong relationship. It’s not a one-off purchase, but an ongoing transaction. You need to let them know how their investments are doing and show clients you understand them as people, including their concerns. </p>
<p>Then, when the time is right, you can pitch new opportunities. If you’re smart, you can set up a real win-win situation with your clients. If they earn more money, then you earn more money, and you both end up better off. </p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a conversation between Robert, an investment advisor, and his client Jessica. Robert wants to give Jessica an update on her current investments before introducing a new opportunity involving a hedge fund. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What expression did Jessica use previously that Robert now brings back up in order to pitch her a new opportunity?<br />
2.	What does Robert say is the main benefit of a hedge fund?<br />
3.	How does Robert respond when Jessica expresses concerns that a hedge fund requires a big investment?</p>

If they earn more money, then you earn more money, and you both end up better off. In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a conversation between Robert, an investment advisor, and his client Jessica. Robert wants to give Jessica an update on her current investments before introducing a new opportunity involving a hedge fund. Listening Questions 1. What expression did Jessica use previously that Robert now brings back up in order to pitch her a new opportunity? 2. What does Robert say is the main benefit of a hedge fund? 3. How does Robert respond when Jessica expresses concerns that a hedge fund requires a big investment?

<p>In this <a title="Business English" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business English</a> News lesson on the trend toward deglobalization, we look at <a title="Business English Vocabulary" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/vocabulary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business English vocabulary</a> related to economics and global trade.</p>
<p>The past few years have been a very interesting time for the world economy. A pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains. Geopolitical tensions around the world have intensified, stoking inflation. In response to these disruptive forces, we are seeing a new international dynamic emerge, as Shroders reports:</p>
<p>A decades-long process of globalization is coming to an end as the world becomes more protectionist, favoring opportunities closer to home. Multinational corporations are diversifying where they produce goods and relocating closer to home. This trend represents backtracking from the globalized model of extended supply chains that have defined international trade in the past few decades.</p>
<p>Many saw globalization as an unassailable model for economic development, one that brought universal benefits. And there are many who see deglobalization, as it’s being called, as either regressive or bad for business. But the cracks in the globalized economy are evident.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a title="Business English" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business English</a> Pod for today’s lesson on how to clarify what was said during a conversation.</p>
<p>Communication is rarely easy. There’s so much that can go wrong in a conversation, especially on the phone. We might not hear someone well, we might hear them incorrectly, and we might not understand words or expressions in the same way. For that reason, we need to be able to clarify what was said.</p>
<p>There are a few basic ways to clarify that are extremely useful. We can use “WH” questions, like who, what, where, when, and why. We can ask people to repeat what they said and repeat things for people when they haven’t understood us. And we can use tag questions to confirm that we’ve heard correctly.</p>
<p>Today we’ll listen to a <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/telephoning/" title="English telephone conversation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">telephone conversation</a> between three colleagues: Benny, Wim, and Andre. They are speaking on the phone for the first time in a while. During their conversation, they use several expressions to clarify what was said.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does the receptionist say that Benny doesn’t understand right away?<br />
2.	What question does Benny ask that Wim needs repeated?<br />
3.	What question does Benny restate about the river in Rotterdam?</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast for today&#8217;s lesson on the impact and implications of DEI &#8211; or diversity, equity, and inclusion &#8211; on the workplace.</p>
<p>As part of the “social” aspect of <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2024/02/18/skills-360-esg-environmental-social-and-governance/" title="ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ESG</a>, DEI has exploded in importance in recent years. Over 50% of employees in the US believe this increasing attention is warranted. And, as we discussed in our last lesson, customers are increasingly discerning when it comes to ethical performance. </p>
<p>So, it’s not just your HR manager who’s thinking about this anymore. The companies that are excelling in this area have it baked in at every level. And that includes commitments at the C-suite level. Given this explosion of attention, it’s worth unpacking exactly what we mean by these terms, and what it means for the workplace.</p>
<p>“Diversity” refers to the presence of different people in an organization. And while we might immediately think about gender and race, we’re also talking about age, disabilities, religion, and sexual orientation, just to name a few. Diverse organizations have many different people. “Inclusion” is an atmosphere where all these people feel a sense of belonging. And where there are systems in place to make them feel welcome and valued.</p>
<p>“Equity” can often get confused with “equality,” but it’s really not the same. Equity acknowledges that not everyone has the same starting point, and that some people might need additional support to take advantage of opportunities. So companies committed to equity focus on systems and processes that create fairness and recognize those different starting points.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Skills 360 podcast for today&#8217;s lesson on “ESG,” or the environmental, social, and governance commitments companies make.</p>
<p>Along with DEI, which we’ll talk about next time, ESG is one of those acronyms that seems to be everywhere these days. Some companies have made huge strides in ESG, and many of them are reaping the rewards. Others have just started down the path. And then there are some that are resisting, for better or worse. Whatever the situation in your company is, it’s important for you to know what ESG is all about.</p>
<p>On a very simple level, ESG is about paying attention to the non-financial impacts, risks, and opportunities in business. The “E” in ESG stands for “environmental.” This refers to a company’s impacts on the environment, its greenhouse gas emissions, its care for natural resources, and its resilience in the face of climate change.</p>
<p>The “S” in ESG stands for “social.” This pillar is all about the company’s relationship with it stakeholders, both internal and external. That includes employee engagement, as well as relationships with the surrounding community and its people. Finally, the “G” in ESG stands for “governance.” This is all about ethical and accountable leadership, board oversight, equity, and transparency.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a title="Business English" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business English</a> Pod the second part of our series on <a title="English idioms" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/business-idioms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English idioms</a> related to animals.</p>
<p>English can be a difficult language to learn. One reason, which you’ve likely discovered, is that there are so many different ways to say something. It’s not just a variety of individual words, but also the variety of idioms. Idioms can be tricky. You might hear someone say “it’s a dog eat dog world” and wonder: why are they talking about dogs?</p>
<p>In fact, a “dog eat dog world” is not about dogs at all. This is an idiom that describes a tough competitive environment. Just like the business world in which you’re trying to learn English so you can compete. English is full of expressions like this. And it turns out that we have dozens of idioms related to animals. </p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll rejoin a conversation among three colleagues in a large corporation. Ruby, Dylan and Kyle have been discussing the Chief Investment Officer position in their company, as well as the world of investments. In their conversation they use many idioms related to animals. See if you can spot some of these as we go through the dialog, and we’ll explain them later in the debrief. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	How does Dylan describe his investment advisor’s work habits?<br />
2.	What does Ruby say to communicate to her colleagues that she doesn’t have special information to share?<br />
3.	What does Dylan believe the company needs to do to prove they’re serious about IT transformation?</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a title="Business English" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business English</a> Pod for today’s lesson on <a title="English idioms" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/business-idioms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English idioms</a> related to animals.</p>
<p>Like all our lessons, this one is focused on language that you can use at work and in business. When you work like a dog, you can’t waste your time learning expressions you’ll never use. And when it comes to idioms, you should focus on the ones that are commonly used and widely understood. Like the one I just used: “to work like a dog.”</p>
<p>In fact, there’s a ton of <a title="Business English Idioms" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/business-idioms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">idioms in English</a> that mention animals, especially dogs. That’s probably because so many of us keep them as pets. But we’ve got idioms about cats, horses, snakes, fish, cows, bears and countless other animals. And learning these idioms can add to your language toolbox and make you sound more natural. Besides, a well-placed idiom can add a lot of impact to a sentence.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll listen to a conversation between Dylan, Ruby, and Kyle &#8211; three colleagues in a large corporation. They’re talking about the Chief Investment Officer position in their company. They discuss the former person in the role, people who applied for the job, and the person who got it. In their conversation they use many idioms related to animals. See if you can spot some of these, and we’ll explain them later in the debrief.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1. How does Ruby describe Greg, the person in finance who applied for the Chief Investment Officer job?<br />
2. How does Dylan describe Brett, the former Chief Investment Officer?<br />
3. What expression does Ruby use to describe the current challenging market?</p>

<p>In this <a title="Business English" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business English</a> News lesson on the economic outlook for 2024, we look at <a title="Business English Vocabulary" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/vocabulary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business English vocabulary</a> related to the global economy and finance.</p>
<p>At the start of every year, economists love to make predictions. But in such a volatile world, predictions are tough to make accurately. For 2023, many economists forecasted rising inflation and a “hard landing” for the global economy. But that didn’t happen. So, what’s in store for 2024? Will the challenges of 2023 snowball into a recession? Not according to MSN.com:</p>
<p>Although growth is estimated to be even slower in 2024, the worst is perhaps over and headwinds are expected to ease, analysts say. For next year, the IMF expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.9 per cent, while the World Bank forecasts 2.4 per cent growth. “Looking at 2024, we anticipate uncertainty to persist, with sub-trend growth projected across the world’s economies,” State Street Global Advisor said in its 2024 Outlook report.</p>
<p>All of this amounts to what many people are anticipating as a “soft landing” for the U.S. economy. The fight against inflation isn’t over, and consumers are still taking it on the chin. But turning the inflationary tide didn’t require high unemployment, as is often the case.</p>

At the start of every year, economists love to make predictions. But in such a volatile world, predictions are tough to make accurately. For 2023, many economists forecasted rising inflation and a “hard landing” for the global economy. But that didn’t happen. So, what’s in store for 2024? Will the challenges of 2023 snowball into a recession? Not according to MSN.com: Although growth is estimated to be even slower in 2024, the worst is perhaps over and headwinds are expected to ease, analysts say. For next year, the IMF expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.9 per cent, while the World Bank forecasts 2.4 per cent growth. “Looking at 2024, we anticipate uncertainty to persist, with sub-trend growth projected across the world’s economies,” State Street Global Advisor said in its 2024 Outlook report. All of this amounts to what many people are anticipating as a “soft landing” for the U.S. economy. The fight against inflation isn’t over, and consumers are still taking it on the chin. But turning the inflationary tide didn’t require high unemployment, as is often the case.

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on how to finish an <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/presentations/" title="English Presentations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English presentation</a> with a summary and a call to action.</p>
<p>An effective <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/presentations/" title="presentation in english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">presentation in english</a> is one that you remember. And an effective presenter is one who knows how to get information to stick and how to make a lasting impression on the audience. But for many people, that’s easier said than done. So how can you get your ideas to stick?</p>
<p>Well, there’s a simple structure that you can follow. That structure involves signaling that you’re going to end your presentation. Next, you can provide a summary of what you’ve discussed. Then you can make a call to action. And finally, you can thank your audience and invite questions. With this structure, you can make a strong finish to your presentation and a lasting impression.</p>
<p>Today we’ll listen to a presentation by Nick, a sales director for a steel company. Nick is giving a presentation about ideas for increasing sales, which have been rather disappointing. He uses several techniques to summarize and emphasize his key points. And he provides a strong finish to his presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does Nick say to introduce the final summary of his main ideas?<br />
2.	What does Nick tell people he wants them to do near the end of the presentation?<br />
3.	What does Nick do to end his presentation?</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English</a> Pod for the second in our two-part series on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2023/11/12/bep-402-recruiting-1-identifying-needs/" title="BEP 402 – Recruiting 1: Identifying Needs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recruiting</a>. Today we’re going to focus on developing the job description. </p>
<p>In the current business climate, the competition for talent is fierce. People looking for work have an array of choices. And because company loyalty isn’t what it once was, people are apt to change jobs every few years. For these reasons, companies have to stay sharp when it comes to recruiting, not to mention retention.</p>
<p>So how can you find the “right” person for a job? Well, that begins with understanding the job itself. In our last lesson we looked at how to identify needs and changes to a role. Once you’ve done that, you’ll be able to develop a suitable job description, and progress on to the hiring phase of the recruiting process.</p>
<p>Developing the job description will require you to outline duties and responsibilities as well as key qualifications for the role. You’ll also have to describe the required experience and personality fit. And in the modern workplace, you’ll likely find yourself discussing in-person versus virtual modes of working. </p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll rejoin Steph, an HR manager, and Maya, a recruiter, as they talk with Josh. Josh is a marketing manager who’s looking to hire a new brand manager. They’ve discussed the role’s changing needs, and now they’re putting together a job description. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What are the minimum qualifications for the role as far as education?<br />
2.	How many years of management experience is required for a successful candidate?<br />
3.	In terms of personality fit, what two characteristics does Josh say are desirable?</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English Podcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English Pod</a> for today’s lesson, the first in a two-part series on recruiting. In this lesson, we’ll focus on identifying your recruiting needs.</p>
<p>The world of human resources has changed dramatically over the past few years. There is more movement in the workforce than ever before, with many people retiring, starting new careers, switching jobs, and reevaluating their priorities. And this kind of movement isn’t likely to stop. The latest generation to enter the workplace have very different values than their parents, and it feels like the days of employee loyalty are officially over.</p>
<p>So how can individual companies deal with these shifts? Well, many HR professionals will tell you that you need to “always be recruiting.” This approach involves a change in mindset for many businesses. It’s about constantly thinking about your changing staffing needs, adapting your systems and approaches when necessary, and strong networking.</p>
<p>A big part of smart recruiting involves identifying your changing needs. When you sit down to look at a role, you might start with an overall description. But then you need to assess changes to the role and compare new needs against former role descriptions. As you build a new job description, you should also ask whether there are skills gaps on the team. And you should develop a general picture of your ideal candidate.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a conversation between Josh, Steph, and Maya. Josh is a marketing manager looking to hire a new brand manager. Steph is an HR manager, and Maya is in charge of recruitment. Together they’re working out how the brand manager role should look.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What kinds of changes to the role does Josh describe?<br />
2.	What specific skills does the team lack that can be a part of the changing brand manager role?<br />
3.	How does Maya describe the ideal candidate for the position?</p>

The latest generation to enter the workplace have very different values than their parents, and it feels like the days of employee loyalty are officially over. So how can individual companies deal with these shifts? Well, many HR professionals will tell you that you need to “always be recruiting.” This approach involves a change in mindset for many businesses. It’s about constantly thinking about your changing staffing needs, adapting your systems and approaches when necessary, and strong networking. A big part of smart recruiting involves identifying your changing needs. When you sit down to look at a role, you might start with an overall description. But then you need to assess changes to the role and compare new needs against former role descriptions. As you build a new job description, you should also ask whether there are skills gaps on the team. And you should develop a general picture of your ideal candidate. In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a conversation between Josh, Steph, and Maya. Josh is a marketing manager looking to hire a new brand manager. Steph is an HR manager, and Maya is in charge of recruitment. Together they’re working out how the brand manager role should look. Listening Questions 1. What kinds of changes to the role does Josh describe? 2. What specific skills does the team lack that can be a part of the changing brand manager role? 3. How does Maya describe the ideal candidate for the position?

In this lesson, we’ll focus on identifying your recruiting needs. The world of human resources has changed dramatically over the past few years. There is more movement in the workforce than ever before, with many people retiring, starting new careers, switching jobs, and reevaluating their priorities.

<p>Welcome back to the Business English Skills 360 podcast for today&#8217;s lesson on <a title="management English" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English management</a> skills and <a title="Managing Up 1: Working with your Boss" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2023/10/08/skills-360-managing-up-1-working-with-your-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to manage up</a>.</p>
<p>Many of us silently yearn for an easy relationship with our boss, one in which he can understand us intuitively. But managers are human. They can’t read minds any better than you can. And even the best ones make mistakes. That’s why today I want to talk about how to “manage up.” I’m talking about using strategies for enhanced collaboration between you and your boss. I want to show you how you can initiate these strategies, rather than waiting for your boss to become a better manager.</p>
<p>The right attitude is critical if you want to learn to manage up. Start by de-escalating any resentment you have toward your boss. Open yourself up to the idea of collaborating with your boss. And cultivate a spirit of learning. Even if you don’t see your boss as a mentor, there’s lots you can learn from him.</p>
<p>With the right attitude, you can then go about trying to understand your boss better. Reflect on what you know about the person. Ask yourself: what is this person’s experience and background? Then, how does this experience and background inform his core values?</p>

<p>Welcome back to the Business English Skills 360 podcast for today&#8217;s lesson on <a title="management English" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English management</a> skills and managing up.</p>
<p>There’s an old saying that people don’t quit jobs, they quit bosses. And according to a recent study, 65% of people would choose a new boss over a pay raise. Without a doubt, our job satisfaction is heavily influenced by the quality of our boss.</p>
<p>But if your boss doesn’t understand you, or doesn’t know how to manage you, or is outright incompetent, you don’t have to suffer in silence. In fact, even people who have great bosses can benefit from what we call “managing up.”</p>
<p>So, what do I mean by managing up? Well, on a basic level, managing up is all about teaching your boss how to be a good manager to you. It’s about improving communication, understanding, and collaboration so that you both benefit from the working relationship.</p>
<p>A lot of us are stuck in a particular way of thinking about power, in other words: your boss has it, and you don’t. But you need to think about your relationship with your boss as one in which you have choice and agency. You can influence outcomes and behavior and improve your work life by improving understanding.</p>
<p>When we manage up, we acknowledge that different people have different ways of communicating, behaving, and working. And we work to understand our boss’s particular style and approach. Think deeply about her expectations, her needs, her preferred communication style, and her goals. Once you have this understanding, then you can adapt.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/socializing/" title="English for socializing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English for socializing</a> with colleagues. Today we’re going to look at how to build deeper conversations with colleagues you’ve met for the first time.</p>
<p>When we meet a colleague for the first time, the conversation is usually pretty light. We introduce ourselves, make small talk about the weather, sports, or travel. And we try to build a bit of a connection with people. Listen to a conversation like this, and you’ll notice that people keep their comments pretty short and don’t spend too long talking about themselves.</p>
<p>Once you’ve established that initial connection, you have an opportunity to build rapport by deepening the conversation. While you might talk a bit more personally than the initial conversation, it’s still important to keep it light. And you need to continue with the back and forth dance of a skilled conversationalist.</p>
<p>In this deepening conversation, you might make comments about the place you’re in or the location. Another easy way to get someone talking is to ask them a number-based question, like how long they’ve lived in a certain place, for example. Skilled people also know how to turn the conversation back to the other person and find similarities to build rapport. And once you have some rapport, you’ll be able to contradict or disagree with people politely.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll rejoin a pair of colleagues – Jen and Ryan &#8211; who’ve just met at a company retreat. In our last lesson, we heard their very first conversation. Now they’re getting to know each other a bit better during a company social event at a bowling alley. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What number-based question does Jen ask Ryan to get him talking?<br />
2.	What similarity in background or family situation does Ryan point out?<br />
3.	What point does Jen make that Ryan disagrees with near the end of the dialog?</p>

Today we’re going to look at how to build deeper conversations with colleagues you’ve met for the first time. When we meet a colleague for the first time, the conversation is usually pretty light. We introduce ourselves, make small talk about the weather, sports, or travel. And we try to build a bit of a connection with people. Listen to a conversation like this, and you’ll notice that people keep their comments pretty short and don’t spend too long talking about themselves. Once you’ve established that initial connection, you have an opportunity to build rapport by deepening the conversation. While you might talk a bit more personally than the initial conversation, it’s still important to keep it light. And you need to continue with the back and forth dance of a skilled conversationalist. In this deepening conversation, you might make comments about the place you’re in or the location. Another easy way to get someone talking is to ask them a number-based question, like how long they’ve lived in a certain place, for example. Skilled people also know how to turn the conversation back to the other person and find similarities to build rapport. And once you have some rapport, you’ll be able to contradict or disagree with people politely. In today’s dialog, we’ll rejoin a pair of colleagues – Jen and Ryan &amp;#8211; who’ve just met at a company retreat. In our last lesson, we heard their very first conversation. Now they’re getting to know each other a bit better during a company social event at a bowling alley. Listening Questions 1. What number-based question does Jen ask Ryan to get him talking? 2. What similarity in background or family situation does Ryan point out? 3. What point does Jen make that Ryan disagrees with near the end of the dialog?

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod for today’s lesson on <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/socializing/" title="English for socializing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English for socializing</a> with your colleagues. In this lesson we’re going to learn how to socialize with colleagues you’re meeting in-person for the first time.</p>
<p>What do you talk about when you meet someone new or see your colleagues socially? Some outgoing people apparently never have to think about it. They’re just natural socializers and feel comfortable with small talk. For most of us though, <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2014/03/02/business-english-pod-247-socializing-with-strangers-english-1/" title="BEP 247 – Socializing with Strangers (1)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">making small talk</a> with new people or co-workers feels uncomfortable at best, or painful at worst. But it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>We call it “small talk” because it’s light, simple, and informal conversation. It’s not serious, deep, or overly formal. Small talk is often about personal matters, but not too personal if it’s at work. We often talk about places or things that are safe and avoid controversial topics. And there’s a flow to small talk that can be tricky to master. Your comments can’t be too short, or you’ll seem rude. But if they’re too long, people will lose interest.</p>
<p>So what can you talk about if you’re meeting colleagues for the first time at say a conference or a company retreat? Well, some key topics include your name and job, of course, but also places and travel. And key strategies include building on other people’s comments, making guesses or inferences, and using unfinished sentences to invite other people to speak. With a handle on these approaches, you can comfortably chat socially with your colleagues.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll hear a conversation at a company retreat. People from a large company are gathering for meetings and team-building. We’ll hear Michelle, Jen, and Ryan meet each other for the first time. In their conversation, you’ll hear the topics and strategies that I just mentioned. </p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What information does Jen give in her short personal introduction?<br />
2.	What comment or fact given by Michelle does Jen build on with a further comment?<br />
3.	What does Jen ask Ryan about once he has introduced himself?</p>

<p>Welcome back to Business English Pod. Today’s lesson is the second in a series about handling suggestions in <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/meetings/" title="English meetings" rel="noopener" target="_blank">English meetings</a>. Last time we looked at how to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/2023/07/16/bep-30c-english-for-meetings-making-suggestions/" title="English for Meetings: Making Suggestions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">make suggestions</a>. And this time we’re going to look at how to <em>respond</em> to suggestions.</p>
<p>Business is a team sport. And behind every successful team is a healthy internal dialog and debate. If you want to succeed in business and be a good team player, you need opinions and the skills to express them effectively. But that doesn’t only mean making your own suggestions. It also means responding to other people’s suggestions.</p>
<p>So in this lesson, we’ll learn different ways of responding to suggestions. That includes responding positively, by accepting or praising the idea. It also includes rejecting ideas or casting doubt on them.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll listen to a marketing team meeting at a sports shoe company. The four colleagues are talking about a new ad campaign. They are making suggestions for a “spokesperson,” or recognizable figure to promote their shoes. During the discussion they use a variety of techniques and language to respond to suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What does Miguel think of Sven’s idea to hire an overweight business executive as a spokesperson?<br />
2.	How does Karen react to Miguel’s suggestion of hiring a famous sports star?<br />
3.	What is the group’s response to Karen’s final suggestion of hiring a golfer?</p>

<p>In this <a title="Business English" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business English</a> News lesson we look at <a title="Business English Vocabulary" href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/vocabulary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business English vocabulary</a> related to tech takeovers or mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Takeovers are a huge part of the <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/it-and-computers/" title="IT English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tech</a> business, and they’re not always hostile. In fact, many young entrepreneurs build niche companies hoping to be acquired. And for the giants of tech, mergers and acquisitions are a critical growth strategy. With the personalities and egos involved, takeovers keep the news cycle buzzing, as the drama at Twitter has shown. According to the Guardian:  </p>
<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in 2022 promised the biggest shake-up since the company was founded. The former world&#8217;s richest man was keen to take on the project after becoming disillusioned by the site&#8217;s perceived biases and content moderation policy. But Twitter&#8217;s revolution became a bloodbath in the process, cutting staff by 80% to hone in on the new direction. Then they lost users and advertisers as a lean team struggled to manage disinformation, trolling and impersonation online.</p>

With the personalities and egos involved, takeovers keep the news cycle buzzing, as the drama at Twitter has shown. According to the Guardian: Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in 2022 promised the biggest shake-up since the company was founded. The former world&amp;#8217;s richest man was keen to take on the project after becoming disillusioned by the site&amp;#8217;s perceived biases and content moderation policy. But Twitter&amp;#8217;s revolution became a bloodbath in the process, cutting staff by 80% to hone in on the new direction. Then they lost users and advertisers as a lean team struggled to manage disinformation, trolling and impersonation online.

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/" title="Business English Pod" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business English Pod</a>. Today’s lesson is the first in a series about making and responding to suggestions in <a href="https://www.businessenglishpod.com/category/meetings/" title="meetings in English" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meetings in English</a>. This is part of a broader project to take another look at some of our older lessons.</p>
<p>Solving problems and coming up with ideas in groups is a big part of work. Succeeding in business means participating effectively in these kinds of group meetings. And to do that, you need to know how to make and respond to suggestions. It’s no use having a good idea if you can’t express it!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’re going to focus on how to make suggestions. We’ll look at several different expressions we use to suggest ideas. Expressions like “one possibility,” and “maybe,” and “how about” are essential when you want to make suggestions in a meeting. And it’s good to have lots of different expressions for different situations.</p>
<p>In today’s dialog, we’ll hear a conversation between four people who work in marketing for a sports shoe company. They are discussing a new ad campaign and coming up with ideas for a “spokesperson,” or a famous person to advertise their new shoes. In their conversation, they use lots of expressions for making suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Listening Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	What words does Sven use to introduce his suggestion of using a famous business executive?<br />
2.	What suggestion does Miguel introduce with the word “perhaps?”<br />
3.	How does Charles introduce his suggestion of choosing someone from a sport where it’s normal to be heavy?</p>
